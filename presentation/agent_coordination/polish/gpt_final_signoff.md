# Observability Sign-off: Ready for Final Review

Date: 2025-08-22

## Conclusion
All concerns raised in the polish reviews are addressed. The service is ready for final review.

## Verification Snapshot
- Structured logging: Uses `log/slog` JSON handler with contextual fields (`connID`, `clientAddr`).
- Metrics (Prometheus text format): `/metrics` exposes HELP/TYPE for
  - `package_indexer_connections_total` (counter)
  - `package_indexer_commands_processed_total` (counter)
  - `package_indexer_errors_total` (counter)
  - `package_indexer_packages_indexed_current` (gauge)
  - `package_indexer_uptime_seconds` (gauge)
- Health checks: `/healthz` reflects readiness via `Server.IsReady()` and sets HTTP 200/503 accordingly.
- Profiling: Full `pprof` suite under `/debug/pprof/` on the admin server.
- Build info: `/buildinfo` returns Go build metadata.
- Graceful shutdown: Toggles readiness false, cancels listener, drains connections with timeout.

## Notes
No blocking concerns remain. Latency histograms are a non-critical future enhancement if SLOs require them.
