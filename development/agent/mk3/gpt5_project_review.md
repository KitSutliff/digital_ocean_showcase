## GPT-5 Project Review

### Scope
- Reviewed `challenge/INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `README.md`, and `development/operator/design_decisions_log.md`.
- Audited core code: `internal/indexer`, `internal/wire`, `internal/server`, and `app/cmd/server`.
- Ran full test suite, coverage, and quick duplication checks.

### Build & Test Status
- All tests passed across packages: internal, app, integration, and suite.
- Coverage summary (from `coverage.txt`):
  - `internal/indexer`: 100%
  - `internal/wire`: 100%
  - `internal/server`: ~95%
  - `app/cmd/server`: main intentionally 0% (entrypoint)
- Command used: `make test-coverage` (generates `coverage.out`, `coverage.txt`, `coverage.html`).

### Protocol & Constants
- Single source of truth for responses in `internal/wire`:
  - `Response.String()` returns `"OK\n"`, `"FAIL\n"`, `"ERROR\n"`.
  - Server writes responses via `response.String()`; tests compare literal strings (acceptable for tests).
- Commands are parsed only in `wire.ParseCommand` with strict spec compliance: requires trailing `\n`, exactly three parts, empty deps allowed, trims trailing comma empties.
- No duplicated protocol constants across production code (only in tests and planning docs).

### Server
- Concurrency model: goroutine per connection, with graceful shutdown via context.
- `processCommand` performs minimal logic and delegates to `indexer`.
- Metrics implemented with atomic counters; `GetSnapshot` returns a point-in-time struct.
- Timeouts set on each read to avoid slowloris; error handling is graceful.
- No dead code found; `handleConnection` is a thin wrapper over `handleConnectionWithContext` and used by tests.

### Indexer
- Dual maps with `StringSet`; RWMutex guards state.
- `IndexPackage` replaces dependency set and maintains reverse edges correctly.
- `RemovePackage` returns (ok, blocked) to distinguish business outcomes; idempotent removal.
- `QueryPackage` uses read lock; `GetStats` used by tests.
- No redundant logic or repeated code blocks.

### CLI Entrypoint
- Flags: `-addr` (default `:8080`), `-quiet` (disables logging via `io.Discard`).
- Graceful signal handling and shutdown with 30s timeout.
- Tests cover flag parsing and subprocess startup behavior; main remains uncovered, which is acceptable.

### Testing & Scripts
- Integration tests spawn a server on dynamic ports and validate protocol, malformed inputs, and concurrency.
- Suite utilities under `testing/suite/` are internal to tests and not reused by production code (OK).
- Scripts `testing/scripts/run_harness.sh` and `run_harness_docker.sh` autodetect harness binary, manage lifecycle, and are consistent with README.

### Documentation Consistency
- README matches implemented structure and commands; Docker and Make targets align.
- Design decisions document aligns with code: strict parsing, RWMutex strategy, quiet logging, dual testing workflows.

### Duplication & Hardcoding Audit
- Responses and commands centralized in `internal/wire`; server never hardcodes response literals.
- Test files assert on explicit strings, which is intentional and standard.
- No repeated parsing logic, delimiter handling, or dependency-graph code in multiple places.
- Metrics strings and names are used once; no duplicated counters.
- Planning docs include example code snippets with literals; they do not affect production code.

### Minor Observations
- `internal/server/server.go` has both `handleConnection` (wrapper) and `handleConnectionWithContext`; both are used in tests and acceptable.
- Coverage for `processCommand` branches is high but not 100%; optional to add targeted unit tests if desired.
- `app/cmd/server/main.go` is intentionally uncovered beyond flag parsing tests; acceptable for an entrypoint.

### Conclusion
- Codebase is clean, cohesive, and free of meaningful duplication or unsafe hardcoding.
- Protocol handling, responses, and dependency graph logic are properly centralized.
- Tests are comprehensive with high coverage; harness scripts align with docs.
- No action required; optional improvements would be minor coverage enhancements only.
