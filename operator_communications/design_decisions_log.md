## 1. Programming Language Selection

### Decision: Go (Golang)

### Options Considered:
- **Go**: Native concurrency, excellent TCP support, static binaries
- **Python**: Rapid development, extensive libraries
- **Rust**: Memory safety, performance
- **Java**: Enterprise-grade concurrency, JVM ecosystem
- **C++**: Maximum performance, low-level control

### Cost-Benefit Analysis:

**Go Advantages:**
- Built-in goroutines and channels for concurrency
- Excellent `net` package for TCP servers
- Static binary compilation for easy deployment
- Standard library-only requirement easily met
- Strong testing framework with race detection
- Simple deployment and cross-compilation

**Go Disadvantages:**
- Less flexibility than dynamic languages
- Garbage collection (minimal impact for this use case)

**Why We Chose Go:**
The challenge requirements (100+ concurrent clients, TCP server, standard library only) align perfectly with Go's strengths. The built-in concurrency primitives and robust `net` package make it the optimal choice for this specific problem domain.

## 2. Concurrency Architecture

### Decision: Goroutine-per-Connection with Shared State

### Options Considered:
- **Goroutine-per-connection**: Simple, scales well to 100+ clients
- **Worker pool pattern**: More complex, better resource control
- **Single-threaded event loop**: Maximum performance, complex to implement
- **Actor model**: Clean isolation, added complexity

### Cost-Benefit Analysis:

**Goroutine-per-Connection Advantages:**
- Simple to implement and reason about
- Natural connection lifecycle management
- Automatic cleanup on client disconnect
- Scales well to the required 100+ concurrent clients
- Easy debugging and logging per connection

**Goroutine-per-Connection Disadvantages:**
- Higher memory usage per connection
- Potential goroutine leak if not managed properly

**Why We Chose Goroutine-per-Connection:**
The simplicity and natural fit with Go's concurrency model outweigh the minor memory overhead. With proper cleanup (defer conn.Close()), it provides robust and scalable architecture.

## 3. Data Structure Design

### Decision: Dual-Map with StringSet Implementation

### Options Considered:
- **Single map with complex values**: `map[string]PackageInfo`
- **Dual-map approach**: Forward + reverse dependency tracking
- **Graph library**: External dependency, more features
- **Database storage**: Persistent, overkill for in-memory requirement

### Cost-Benefit Analysis:

**Dual-Map Advantages:**
- O(1) dependency lookups in both directions
- Clear separation of concerns
- Efficient memory usage with StringSet
- Easy to maintain consistency
- Fast removal validation (check dependents)

**Dual-Map Disadvantages:**
- More complex state management
- Need to maintain consistency between maps
- Slightly more memory usage

**Final Structure:**
```go
type Indexer struct {
    indexed      StringSet                // packages currently indexed
    dependencies map[string]StringSet     // pkg -> its dependencies
    dependents   map[string]StringSet     // pkg -> packages depending on it
}
```

**Why We Chose Dual-Map:**
The O(1) lookup performance for both "what does X depend on" and "what depends on X" is crucial for the REMOVE operation validation. The added complexity is worth the performance benefit.

## 4. Thread Safety Strategy

### Decision: Single RWMutex with Read/Write Lock Strategy

### Options Considered:
- **Single RWMutex**: Simple, all operations protected
- **Fine-grained locking**: Multiple mutexes, complex deadlock potential
- **Lock-free data structures**: High performance, very complex
- **Channel-based synchronization**: Go-idiomatic, added complexity

### Cost-Benefit Analysis:

**Single RWMutex Advantages:**
- No deadlock potential
- Simple to reason about
- Allows concurrent reads (QUERY operations)
- Exclusive writes ensure consistency
- Well-tested pattern in Go

**Single RWMutex Disadvantages:**
- Write operations block all reads
- Potential bottleneck under extreme load

**Locking Strategy:**
- QUERY: Read lock (allows concurrent queries)
- INDEX/REMOVE: Write lock (exclusive access)

**Why We Chose Single RWMutex:**
The simplicity and correctness guarantee outweigh the performance trade-off. For the 100+ client requirement, this provides adequate performance while ensuring data consistency.

## 5. Protocol Parsing Strategy

### Decision: Strict Specification-Only Validation

### Options Considered:
- **Minimal validation**: Only check format structure
- **Extended validation**: Validate package names, dependency formats
- **Permissive parsing**: Accept variations in format
- **Strict specification-only**: Validate exactly what spec requires

### Cost-Benefit Analysis:

**Specification-Only Advantages:**
- Guaranteed compatibility with test harness
- No false negatives from over-validation
- Exactly matches protocol requirements
- Future-proof against test variations

**Specification-Only Disadvantages:**
- May accept "unusual" but valid input
- Less defensive programming

**Validation Rules Applied:**
1. Command must be INDEX/REMOVE/QUERY
2. Package name must be non-empty
3. Format must be `cmd|pkg|deps\n`
4. NO character-level restrictions on package names

**Why We Chose Specification-Only:**
Critical insight from team review: over-validation is a common trap that causes false negatives with test harnesses. The spec defines the contract - anything beyond that risks compatibility issues.

## 6. Error Handling Philosophy

### Decision: Graceful Degradation with Comprehensive Logging

### Options Considered:
- **Fail-fast**: Crash on any error
- **Silent failure**: Continue without indication
- **Graceful degradation**: Log and continue
- **Retry mechanisms**: Complex for this use case

### Cost-Benefit Analysis:

**Graceful Degradation Advantages:**
- Server stays running despite client errors
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Individual client errors don't affect others
- Matches expected server behavior

**Graceful Degradation Disadvantages:**
- More complex error handling code
- Potential to mask serious issues

**Error Response Strategy:**
- Parse errors → ERROR response
- Business logic failures → FAIL response
- Protocol violations → ERROR response
- Connection errors → log and cleanup

**Why We Chose Graceful Degradation:**
A robust server should handle individual client errors without affecting the overall system. Comprehensive logging provides visibility without compromising stability.

## 7. Performance Optimization Decisions

### Decision: Conditional Logging with -quiet Flag

### Options Considered:
- **Always log**: Great for debugging, performance impact
- **Never log**: Maximum performance, no debugging info
- **Log levels**: Complex infrastructure for this scope
- **Conditional flag**: Simple toggle, best of both worlds

### Cost-Benefit Analysis:

**Conditional Logging Advantages:**
- Debug capability when needed
- Performance optimization when required
- Simple implementation with `io.Discard`
- Clear operational control

**Conditional Logging Disadvantages:**
- Requires operational awareness
- Two different runtime behaviors

**Implementation:**
```go
quiet := flag.Bool("quiet", false, "Disable logging for performance")
if *quiet {
    log.SetOutput(io.Discard)
}
```

**Why We Chose Conditional Logging:**
Team insight: I/O contention from logging can be a bottleneck at 100+ concurrent clients. The flag provides the best of both worlds - debugging when needed, performance when required.

---

## 8. Cross-Platform Compatibility

### Decision: Environment Variable with OS Auto-Detection

### Options Considered:
- **Hardcode platform**: Simple, not portable
- **Runtime detection**: Automatic, less control
- **Environment variable only**: Manual, explicit
- **Hybrid approach**: Auto-detect with override

### Cost-Benefit Analysis:

**Hybrid Approach Advantages:**
- Works out-of-the-box on common platforms
- Allows manual override for edge cases
- Clear error messages when binary missing
- Supports CI/CD environments

**Hybrid Approach Disadvantages:**
- Slightly more complex script logic
- Need to handle detection failures

**Implementation:**
```bash
HARNESS_BIN=${HARNESS_BIN:-"./do-package-tree_$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')"}
```

**Why We Chose Hybrid Approach:**
Team insight highlighted that hardcoded platform assumptions break CI/CD and cross-platform development. The hybrid approach provides smart defaults with explicit override capability.

## 9. Testing Strategy

### Decision: Comprehensive Multi-Layer Testing

### Options Considered:
- **Unit tests only**: Fast, limited coverage
- **Integration tests only**: Realistic, harder to debug
- **Manual testing**: Flexible, not repeatable
- **Multi-layer approach**: Comprehensive, more work

### Testing Layers Implemented:
1. **Unit Tests**: Protocol parsing, indexer logic, concurrency
2. **Integration Tests**: Full TCP server with real connections
3. **Stress Tests**: High concurrency with multiple seeds
4. **Official Harness**: Black-box validation

### Cost-Benefit Analysis:

**Multi-Layer Advantages:**
- Catches different types of issues
- Fast feedback from unit tests
- Realistic validation from integration tests
- Confidence from stress testing

**Multi-Layer Disadvantages:**
- More complex test infrastructure
- Longer development time

**Why We Chose Multi-Layer:**
The complexity of concurrent systems requires testing at multiple levels. Each layer catches different classes of bugs that others might miss.

## 10. Documentation Strategy

### Decision: Accurate Technical Documentation with Operational Clarity

### Options Considered:
- **Minimal docs**: Just the basics
- **Marketing-style**: Impressive but potentially misleading
- **Technical accuracy**: Precise but potentially dry
- **Balanced approach**: Accurate and clear

### Documentation Issues Resolved:
- **Health Check**: Fixed "built-in endpoint" → "TCP port probe"
- **Makefile Comments**: Removed misleading server lifecycle note
- **Stats Monitoring**: Fixed non-existent endpoint reference

### Cost-Benefit Analysis:

**Technical Accuracy Advantages:**
- No misleading information
- Trustworthy for engineers
- Accurate operational guidance
- Professional credibility

**Technical Accuracy Disadvantages:**
- Less "impressive" marketing language
- Requires more careful review

**Why We Chose Technical Accuracy:**
Team review caught several misleading statements that could cause confusion during implementation. Accurate documentation builds trust and prevents operational issues.
