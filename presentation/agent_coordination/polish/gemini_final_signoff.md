# Final Observability Sign-off

Date: 2025-08-22

## Conclusion
A thorough review of the codebase confirms that all observability concerns raised in the `claude`, `gemini`, and `gpt` polish reviews have been fully addressed. The implementation meets or exceeds production-readiness standards.

## Verification Checklist
- **[✓] Structured Logging**: Implemented using `log/slog` with contextual `connID` and `clientAddr`.
- **[✓] Prometheus Metrics**: `/metrics` endpoint serves standard Prometheus text format with all required counters and gauges.
- **[✓] Health Checks**: `/healthz` accurately reflects server readiness (`Server.IsReady()`) and uses correct HTTP status codes (200/503).
- **[✓] Profiling**: `pprof` endpoints are correctly exposed on the isolated admin server.
- **[✓] Build Information**: `/buildinfo` endpoint provides necessary build metadata.
- **[✓] Graceful Shutdown**: The shutdown sequence correctly drains connections, manages the readiness state, and respects timeouts.

All systems are verified. The service is ready for final review.
