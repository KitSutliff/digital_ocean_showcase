## GPT Review and Improvement Proposal (v1)

### Scope evaluated
- Build and run locally (Go 1.24.5) and via `make build`
- Unit and integration tests with race detector: `go test -race ./...`
- Official DigitalOcean harness execution via `./scripts/run_harness.sh`
- High-concurrency harness run: `-concurrency=100 -seed=1`
- Project structure and code quality (`internal/indexer`, `internal/server`, `internal/wire`, `cmd/server`)
- Dockerfile and operational scripts (`scripts/*`, `Makefile`)

### Findings (summary)
- Correctness: Implementation adheres to spec for INDEX/REMOVE/QUERY. Re-index updates dependencies correctly; REMOVE enforces reverse-dependency guards; QUERY reflects current state.
- Concurrency: Shared state protected by a single `sync.RWMutex` (read for QUERY, write for INDEX/REMOVE). Race detector clean. Harness passes at 100 concurrent clients.
- Protocol: Strict parsing matches spec: requires trailing `\n`, exactly 3 pipe-separated fields, command must be INDEX/REMOVE/QUERY, non-empty package, deps parsed from comma list.
- Tests: Solid coverage across units and integration. One unrelated failure occurs only when sweeping the bundled `test-suite/` package with `go test ./...` (not part of server code). Harness itself passes fully.
- Docs/DevEx: README is clear; Makefile and scripts are helpful. Dockerfile is close, but minor issues (see below).

### Issues and risks detected
- Test sweep scope:
  - Running `go test -race ./...` sweeps `test-suite/` and trips `TestMakeBrokenMessage` randomness assertion. This is unrelated to the server and can confuse CI.
- Dockerfile mismatches:
  - Copies `go.sum` which does not exist; will fail in clean builds.
  - Go version mismatch: module declares Go 1.24.5 while Docker uses `golang:1.21-alpine`. Potential differences in behavior.
- Operational hardening:
  - No per-connection read deadline; a slowloris client could tie up a goroutine.
  - No graceful shutdown path (no context-driven stop), making test/ops cleanup less controlled.

### What we executed (tests run)
- Build: `make build` (OK)
- Tests: `go test -race ./...` (server and internal packages OK; external `test-suite` package fails one case due to RNG uniqueness assertion)
- Harness default: `./scripts/run_harness.sh` (All tests passed)
- Harness stress: `./scripts/run_harness.sh -concurrency=100 -seed=1` (All tests passed)

### Proposed tests to add for 100% meaningful coverage
- `internal/server/handleConnection` direct unit test
  - Use `net.Pipe()` or a localhost TCP listener to feed multiple lines including malformed input and confirm per-line response correctness and connection lifecycle logging paths. This will explicitly cover the read loop and error branches (EOF vs non-EOF errors).
- `internal/server/Start` error branches
  - Refactor `Start` to accept an optional `net.Listener` (via functional option or constructor). Inject a stub listener that returns errors on `Accept()` to cover the error logging and loop `continue` path. Also test a bind failure path is already covered.
- Long-line/large-input protocol
  - Validate that `bufio.Reader.ReadString('\n')` handles large messages without scanner token limits; add a test that sends a very long dependency list to exercise the code path.
- Dependency bookkeeping assertions (white-box via exported stats hook or table-driven sequences)
  - Assert that re-indexing removes stale reverse-dependencies (already indirectly tested); add direct assertions via exported method or a test-only accessor to confirm cleanup maps are empty where expected.
- Quiet mode plumbing
  - End-to-end test that server started with `-quiet` still processes at high throughput (smoke test already OK); keep as a lightweight integration to ensure flag wiring isn’t regressed.

Example skeletons:

```go
// server_handleconnection_test.go
func TestHandleConnection_ReadLoopAndErrors(t *testing.T) {
    srv := server.NewServer(":0")
    // Start a real listener and connect a client; send mixed valid/invalid lines,
    // then close client to trigger EOF path.
}
```

```go
// server_start_injected_listener_test.go
type errListener struct{ net.Listener }
func (e *errListener) Accept() (net.Conn, error) { return nil, errors.New("accept-fail") }

func TestStart_AcceptErrorLoop(t *testing.T) {
    l, _ := net.Listen("tcp", ":0")
    el := &errListener{Listener: l}
    srv := server.NewServerWithListener(el) // new ctor or option
    // Ensure it logs and continues (run in goroutine with context cancel)
}
```

### Proposed code changes (small, high-value)
- Test reliability and CI
  - Update `Makefile` test target to only include repo code and integration tests:
    - Replace `go test -race ./...` with `go test -race ./internal/... ./cmd/... ./tests/...`
  - Add `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out` and `-covermode=atomic` for CI.
- Dockerfile fixes
  - Remove `go.sum` from copy or generate it. Since there are no external deps, simplest is:
    - Change `COPY go.mod go.sum ./` → `COPY go.mod ./`
    - Optionally remove `RUN go mod download` in builder stage.
  - Align Go version in Docker image to module version (bump to `golang:1.24-alpine` when available, or set `go 1.21` in `go.mod` to match the base image).
- Graceful shutdown and deadlines
  - Add server shutdown support: manage listener and goroutines with `context.Context`, provide `Stop()` to close listener and wait for active handlers.
  - Set per-connection read deadlines (e.g., `conn.SetReadDeadline(time.Now().Add(…))` and refresh per successful read) to mitigate slowloris.
- Minor refactors to improve testability
  - Accept `net.Listener` via constructor or option to enable deterministic tests of `Accept` error paths.
  - Expose a minimal, test-only getter or stats snapshot for `indexer` to assert internal map cleanup.

### Path to 100% coverage (practical and meaningful)
1. Add unit tests for `handleConnection` to cover:
   - Valid line → OK/FAIL/ERROR responses
   - EOF handling path
   - Write error path (simulate closed client during write)
2. Add injected-listener tests to cover `Start` loop `Accept` error branch.
3. Add long-line input test to exercise protocol read path with large payloads.
4. Add direct assertions for re-index cleanup using a stats or test accessor.
5. Exclude non-repo packages from default `make test` target to keep coverage focused and stable.

With the above, remaining uncovered lines should be limited to logging defaults; tests will execute all branches in `server`, `indexer`, and `wire` paths.

### Suggested CI steps
```bash
go test -race -covermode=atomic -coverprofile=coverage.out ./internal/... ./cmd/... ./tests/...
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | tee coverage.txt
```

### Submission readiness checklist
- Harness passes across seeds and `-concurrency=100` (validated)
- Race detector clean (validated)
- Tests scoped to repo code; stable coverage target configured
- Dockerfile adjusted (copy step and Go version)
- Optional: graceful shutdown and read deadlines implemented

### Appendix: commands used
```bash
make build
go test -race ./...              # observed external test-suite failure only
./scripts/run_harness.sh         # All tests passed
./scripts/run_harness.sh -concurrency=100 -seed=1  # All tests passed
```
